    <h1>Mission Statement (Goals)</h1>
    <p>
        This website is intended to increase the number of sales of tickets for performances by the Barrier Reef Orchestra and other local musical groups.
        It is also intended to encourage classical musicians from Townsville and Cairns to join and become members/players of the orchestra.
    </p>

    <h1>Success Evaluation</h1>
    <p>
        This website will be deemed successful if the total revenue of the Barrier Reef Orchestra is increased by 30% over a period of 12 months.
        This increase in revenue will be a result from an increased number of ticket sales for performances of the orchestra.
    </p>

    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <p>
        This website is to cater primarily for classical music enthusiasts. As the orchestra involves players of all ages, the website will not be
        designed for any specific age demographic but instead it will be designed to appeal to an all-ages audience. To achieve this, the following
        guidelines will be used for the overall design on the website:
        <ul>
            <li>Use of gender and age neutral colours (predominately a shade of grey)</li>
            <li>Use of eligible fonts with a moderately large font size for text content.</li>
            <li>Use of photos of the orchestra, other local musical groups and listing upcoming performances.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
