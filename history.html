<!-- Main content for BRO History -->
    <p>
        Over a 2 year period in the late 90's, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who had a love
        for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra - one that would flourish and become
        an integral part of the city's cultural life.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the year 2000, a weekend workshop was arranged in order to test the viability of establishing an Orchestra.
        Musicians were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School
        of Music. The outcome of this workshop was the birth of the Barrier Reef Orchestra.

        Typically the Barrier Reef Orchestra performs 3 times a year, generally with a guest conductor and occasionally
        with other performing groups, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc. Smaller ensembles, using
        players from the Orchestra, regularly give other concerts such as:

    <ul>
        <li>Orpheus Strings</li>
        <li>Pandanus Winds</li>
        <li>Kingfisher Trio</li>
        <li>Centenary Concert Band</li>
        <li>Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra</li>
    </ul>
