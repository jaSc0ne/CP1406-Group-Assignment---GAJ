<h1>CP1406/1806/5638 - 2017 Group Project Report</h1>
<h2>Group Number 127</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Jason Paix, Ghazala Rahuma</p>

<h2>Project Links</h2>

<p><strong>Slack was not used at all for communication between group members, as neither of us set up accounts.</strong></p>

<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>any details required to test the site, including instructions if needed, outstanding issues
    (like things that look as though they work but don't)</p>
<ul>
    <li>This was designed for large monitors only. Therefore the website will crop out on smaller devices (phones, tablets, etc...)</li>
    <li>Fixed widths and position tools were used instead of percentages of the screen size. Therefore it will not change if the browser size or screen size changes.</li>
    <li>No Javascript was implemented due to time constraints (was going to be used for validity checking in sign-up sheet)</li>
    <li>Not all artists have their own pages, only 5 pages have these available.</li>
    <li>These 5 are: Adam Lopez, Domenico Taraborrelli, Jennifer Bradstreet, Richard McIntyre and Sean O'Boyle</li>
</ul>

<h2>References</h2>
<p>references (links) for any code, images or content that you have used that are not your own</p>
<ul>
    <li>All images of musicians and conductors used in the Musicians page come from: <a href="http://nqorchestra.com.au/our-team/">http://nqorchestra.com.au/our-team/</a></li>
    <li>Abstracts for each musician were also obtained from the aforementioned link</li>
    <li>Other images were taken from BRO content zip folder made available to us via a LearnJCU link.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pluses: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>We were able to work on the project at the same time as long as we worked on different pages</li>
        <li>Work was divided between the two of us so we could work on our tasks in our own time</li>
        <li>Able to bounce ideas off of each other and help each other when unsure about certain choices.</li>
        <li>Jason focused more on structural layout and content, while Ghazala focused more on CSS styles.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Minuses: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>GITHUB would overwrite other collaborators work when synchronising the local repository on the desktop with the online repository if both of us were working on the same file</li>
        <li>Had some creative differences in the CSS styles used at first. An agreement was reached.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interesting: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML has the strangest commenting syntax I have ever seen.</li>
        <li>Designing the page layouts using CSS was a lot more efficient than using a table format</li>
        <li>Div blocks are essential for good structural layout.</li>
        <li>A combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript is essential for successful websites.</li>
    </ul>
